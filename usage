This is a project where I had to recode the printf function in C.
usage :

int my_printf(const char *format, ...)

Call the function in a program with format followed by arguments to print
and then compile your C file with the library created by the Makefile

Example :

int my_printf(const char *, ...)

int main(void)
{
  char *str = "hello"
  
  my_printf("%s\n", str);
  return (0);
}
